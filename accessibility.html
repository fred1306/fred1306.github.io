      <h2 id="commitment-heading" class="section-title">Our Commitment</h2>
      <p class="fs-5">
        We want everyone who visits the BulletByte Technologies website to be able to access information and use our services.
        This includes people using screen readers, keyboard navigation, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software,
        and other assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to follow the <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA</strong> wherever
        it is reasonably possible. Accessibility is an ongoing effort, and we regularly review our content and features
        to identify and fix issues that may impact our visitors.

      <h2 id="measures-heading" class="h3 mt-4">Measures We Take</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some of the ways we support accessibility on our site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using clear headings and structure to organize content.</li>
        <li>Providing text alternatives (alt text) for informative images and icons.</li>
        <li>Supporting keyboard navigation for menus, links, and buttons where possible.</li>
        <li>Choosing high-contrast color combinations to improve readability.</li>
        <li>Using descriptive link text instead of generic “click here.”</li>
        <li>Labeling forms clearly and providing helpful instructions and error messages.</li>
        <li>Using responsive design so content works on different devices and screen sizes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="status-heading" class="h3 mt-4">Current Accessibility Status</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that no website is perfectly accessible to everyone. You may encounter some limitations in certain areas.
        When we become aware of an issue, we prioritize improvements that affect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Online booking and appointment pages.</li>
        <li>Service descriptions, pricing, and package information.</li>
        <li>Contact forms and key policy pages such as privacy and terms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some parts of our site rely on third-party providers (for example: maps, booking, and payment systems).
        While we try to choose tools that support accessibility, we do not control all aspects of these services.
      </p>
